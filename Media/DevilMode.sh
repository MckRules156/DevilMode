# üá¨üáß ENGLISH:

# This Termux script simulates that your phone is possessed.

# Once the script is executed, a series of paranormal 
# events will begin to occur.

# 0. Your device's volume will be set to the maximum.

# 1. A demonic voice will come from the phone, warning that 
#    your device has just been possessed. Then, a devilish 
#    laugh will be heard, accompanied by a satanic melody.

# 2. Your wallpaper will change to a more sinister one.

# 3. Your phone will start vibrating infinitely.

# 4. The flashlight will start turning on and off by itself.

# 5. Floating messages will begin to appear on your phone.

# 6. You will start receiving notifications from the devil.

# 7. Creepy messages will be displayed in the Terminal.

# 8. A demonic server will be created and opened in the browser.

# When you press Ctrl + C, everything will return to normal 
# within a few seconds.

# If you want your wallpaper to return to the one you had before, 
# add it to the Media folder with the name: oldwallpaper.jpg 
# for the main wallpaper and oldwallpaperlock.jpg for the 
# lock screen wallpaper.
