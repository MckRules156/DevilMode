## Script Installation üíª

#### 1. Install Termux  
If you don‚Äôt have **Termux** installed yet, you can download it from [Termux (F-Droid)](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/).  

#### 2. Install the Termux:API extension  
Simply go to the following link to download the extension: [Termux:API (F-Droid)](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux.api/).  

#### 3. Install DevilMode
Run the following commands in the **Termux** terminal:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MckRules156/DevilMode.git
cd DevilMode
chmod +x Installer.sh
bash Installer.sh
bash DevilMode.sh
```

## Script Settings ‚öôÔ∏è  

#### 1. Configuration of the eerie messages displayed in the terminal  
To configure these messages, you can modify the "Mensajes" variable in the "DevilMode.sh" script.  

#### 2. Script timer configuration  
In the "timer" function of the "DevilMode.sh" script, you can adjust the timer delay.  

#### 3. Script audio configuration  
You can change the script's audio by replacing the file "Media/music.mp3" with your preferred audio file.  

#### 4. Wallpaper configuration  
Replace the file "Media/oldwallpaper.jpg" with your current wallpaper and "Media/oldwallpaperlock.jpg" with your lock screen wallpaper. The script will use these files to restore your original wallpapers when it stops.  

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è  

If you encounter issues when running the installer `Instalador.sh`, it may be due to missing dependencies. If this happens, you can install them manually by following these steps:  

Open **Termux** and run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:  

```bash
pkg install php -y
pkg install termux-tools -y
pkg install termux-api -y
pkg install xdg-utils -y
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
```

## How to Use the Script? üöÄ

**1. Using the script for personal use:**  
To run the script, make sure you have completed the installation without errors and simply navigate to the "DevilMode" folder and execute the "DevilMode.sh" script

```bash
cd DevilMode
bash DevilMode.sh
```

**2. Using the script to surprise a friend (With their consent):**  
If your goal is to surprise a friend, you can set a timer before executing the script and find an excuse to lend them your phone. Once your friend is using your device and the timer runs out, the script will start unexpectedly. At that moment, your friend will likely be puzzled, wondering: "What is happening here?". Given how surreal and strange this script is, anyone in that situation will be completely bewildered.

To do this, you can run the following command: (Allows Termux to run in the background and sets a 1-minute timer before launching the script)

```bash
termux-wake-lock && sleep 60 && bash DevilMode.sh
```
If you want to take the experience to the next level, try installing the script on someone else's phone without them noticing and schedule its execution. I guarantee that, in that case, the surprise will be much more intense.
